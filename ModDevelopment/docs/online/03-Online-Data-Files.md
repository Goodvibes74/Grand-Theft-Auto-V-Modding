# 3. Online data files on disk

What Online reads that is actually in this install, where it is, and what each file is good for offline. Everything here is **Verified** unless marked otherwise. Paths are inside the archives; extract with `tools/rpf-cw.ps1` (guide 5).

## 3.1 Where Online content lives

| Cutscenes, animations, audio | DLC packs | |

## 3.2 Local mission files (UGC)

1,001 JSON files in Rockstar's mission-creator format (the same format as cloud jobs). File names are `<name>_<variant>_<language>.ugc` or `<name>_<language>.ugc`.

| Prefix | Files | Content (examples) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `re_` | 180 | Freemode random events: armoured truck, army convoy, Cerberus, Christmas truck, crime scene |
| `salvage_` | 94 | Salvage Yard robberies (The Chop Shop): preps and finales (arena, cargo ship, casino, Mission Row, submarine) |
| `dispatch_` | 87 | Dispatch work: bomb, CCTV, drugs, heli, informant, prisoner transport |
| `xmas25_` | 73 | December 2025 update: firefighter odd jobs, survival |
| `sum25_` | 69 | Summer 2025 (Money Fronts): car wash jobs, Higgins chases and impounds |
| `prep_` | 66 | Diamond Casino Heist preps: disruption (armour, backup, weapons), equipment (torch, charges, fingerprint cracker) |
| `fixer_` | 62 | The Contract: security contracts (assault, protect, recovery, rescue, tail) |
| `xmas22_` | 50 | Los Santos Drug Wars: phone missions (crop dusting, drug lord, supply line), sell missions |
| `sum2_` | 50 | The Criminal Enterprises: Ammu-Nation, auto shop, bar resupply, drug problem, Juggernaut |
| `hacker_` | 42 | Agents of Sabotage (*probable*): preps and finales (plane, Tiki, whistle, Zancudo) |
| `daily_` | 40 | Daily bounty, stash house |
| `tuner_` | 39 | LS Tuners robbery preps (container manifest, IAA pass, inside man, key codes) |
| `smuggler_` | 35 | Smuggling resupply and operations (carrier, facility, airstrike) |
| `gr_` | 26 | Gunrunning |
| `arms_` | 20 | Arms trafficking (Cargobob, plane, Ratel, rival) |
| `bounty_` | 18 | Bottom Dollar Bounties targets |
| `bike_` | 14 | MC time trials |
| `dj_` | 12 | Nightclub DJ missions (Dr. Dre, Keinemusik) |
| `bb_` | 5 | Aircraft carrier, captured UFO, factory raid (Business Battles, *probable*) |
| hashed IDs | 13 + 3 | The Cayo Perico Heist finale in 13 languages; "Learning the Ropes" (Gerald's tutorial) solo and normal, and "All or Nothing" |
| test | 4 | `tutorial_mission_0`, `loadeddatatest1/3` |

**Format.** Top-level keys are `meta` (locations, vehicle hashes, weapons) and `mission`. `mission` holds sections such as `gen` (general settings and the title in `nm`), `cover`, `door`, `dprop` (props), `endcon` (end conditions and positions), and lists of peds, vehicles, objects, locations and rules. Coordinates are plain `x/y/z` objects. For example, the tutorial's drop-off point is `-61.6, -1513.7, 32.4`, next to Gerald's apartment (the same spot CruelMasters uses).

**Offline use.** These files describe what to spawn, where, and the objectives. Rockstar's scripts play them; an offline player would need our own interpreter (guide 4, section 4.5). Even without one, they are a ready source of authentic coordinates, vehicles, peds and objectives for hand-written missions.

## 3.3 Stats definitions

`mpstatssetup.xml` defines every Online stat: name, type (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `packed` bools or ints, dates, strings), save category, whether it is per character, `ServerAuthoritative`, and a comment.

- 17,933 stats; 13,630 server-authoritative; 17,177 per character.
- Packed stats store 64 booleans or 8 small integers each (`MP_PSTAT_BOOL0`, `TUPSTAT_INT2`) and hold most mission and unlock flags.
- **Offline use:** a map of everything Online tracks. When we add a system (properties, businesses, unlocks), this file says what state Rockstar keeps for it, so our save can hold the same thing.

## 3.4 Clothing catalogues

Each DLC has a male and a female `*_shop.meta`. Each entry is one item or outfit:

- `uniqueNameHash` (for example `DLC_MP_SUM23_M_OUTFIT_5`), `textLabel` (the name shown in the shop, for example `CLO_SCM_O_5`), `cost` (in dollars), `lockHash` (the unlock it needs, for example `CU_SUM23_CLOTHES_G9EC`), and the component slots it uses (`PV_COMP_UPPR`, `PV_COMP_LOWR`, `PV_COMP_FEET` ...).
- **Offline use:** the data source for real clothes shops (roadmap item 9): names, prices and categories come straight from Rockstar's catalogue instead of guessing drawable numbers.

## 3.5 Preset outfits and property elements (`scriptmetadata.meta`)

- `MPOutfitsData` (male and female): 3,868 preset outfits with component drawables, textures, props and tattoos. These are the heist, job and event outfits.
- `MPApparelData`: apparel definitions.
- `BaseElements` / `BaseElementLocationsMap`: placements inside properties, starting at `-795.2, 326.8, 207.0`, the Eclipse Towers custom apartment area.
- **Offline use:** outfits for AI players (roadmap phase 43) and crew outfits for missions, without hand-picking components.

## 3.6 Property entrances (`ambient_mp.ipl`)

A list of script trigger points placed in the world. When the player comes near one, the engine starts the named script.

| Script | Points | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AM_MP_PROPERTY_EXT` | 83 | Apartment and garage entrances across the map, for example `-197.3, 88.1, 68.7` and `-973.4, -1429.4, 5.2` |
| `AM_MP_CARWASH_LAUNCH` | 2 | Car washes |
| `ob_mp_bed_low`, `ob_mp_bed_med`, `ob_mp_shower_low`, `ob_mp_shower_med` | 4 | Low and medium apartment bed and shower activities |
| `am_cp_snitch` | 1 | Snitch activity |

**Offline use:** the exact entrance positions for garages and apartments (roadmap items 39 and 40). Rockstar's `am_mp_property_ext` won't run offline, but our own script can watch the same points.

## 3.7 Vehicle mod catalogue (`shop_vehicle.meta`)

Entries with `lockHash`, `nameHash`, `type` (`VMT_HORN`, ...) and `cost`. These are mod shop items and their unlocks. **Offline use:** prices and unlocks for the mod shop.
